On successful completion of this Course Unit students will be able to:

Describe the challenges faced and the fundamental concepts associated with distributed computing.
Explain and implement algorithms used in distributed computing.
Explain the trade-offs involved when designing a distributed processing system.

## Weekly Plan Overview

### Week 1: Foundations & Setup (10–14 Apr)
- [ ] Set up Visual Studio (if not done)
- [ ] Review C++ matrix operations (addition, multiplication)
- [ ] Understand the provided framework (if available)
- [ ] Write clean, single-threaded versions of:
  - [ ] Matrix multiplication
  - [ ] Matrix transpose
  - [ ] Optional: Determinant / inverse

> **Focus:** Accuracy & logic clarity

---

### ⚙️ Week 2: Parallel Programming Basics (15–21 Apr)
- [ ] Learn basic multithreading in C++:
  - [ ] `std::thread`
  - [ ] `std::async`
  - [ ] OpenMP
- [ ] Rewrite matrix multiplication using:
  - [ ] `std::thread`
  - [ ] OpenMP (if allowed)
- [ ] Benchmark code using `std::chrono`

> **Focus:** Understanding parallelism fundamentals

---

### Week 3: Optimisation & Advanced Concepts (22–28 Apr)
- [ ] Try different parallelisation strategies:
  - [ ] Row-based
  - [ ] Block-based
- [ ] Experiment with:
  - [ ] Thread counts
  - [ ] Static vs dynamic workload
- [ ] Study distributed computing concepts:
  - [ ] Thread safety
  - [ ] Load balancing
  - [ ] Cache locality
- [ ] Start collecting ideas for the short report

> **Focus:** Writing faster and smarter code

---

### Week 4: Mock Assessment Practice (29 Apr – 5 May)
- [ ] Simulate assessment (3–4 hour test run):
  - [ ] Single-threaded code
  - [ ] Parallel version
  - [ ] Execution time logging
- [ ] Write a practice short report:
  - [ ] Concepts used
  - [ ] Trade-offs made
- [ ] Get feedback if possible

> **Focus:** Confidence & timing

---

### Week 5: Final Review & Polish (6–14 May)
- [ ] Review all threading tools used
- [ ] Finalise short report templates
- [ ] Practice “clean code” runs with minimal debugging
- [ ] Prepare checklist for assessment day

> **Focus:** Final tuning and mental readiness

---

## Assessment Day Checklist (15 May 2025)
- [ ] Framework understood
- [ ] Algorithm implemented correctly
- [ ] Output matches expected test cases
- [ ] Parallelisation complete using multithreading
